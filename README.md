# Energy-Savings-in-Singapore-from-Recycling-DataCamp-Challenge
Singapore has an ambitious goal of becoming a zero-waste nation. The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has increased seven-fold over the last 40 years. At this rate, Semakau Landfill, Singaporeâ€™s only landfill, will run out of space by 2035. Making matters worse, Singapore has limited land for building new incineration plants or landfills.  The government would like to motivate citizens by sharing the total energy that the combined recycling efforts have saved every year. This project is all about findings energy savings due to recycling in Singapore.
